        <h1>Target</h1>
        <p>Every year, a large contingent of people are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Becoming better financially educated</li>
            <li>Looking for new ways to make their investments</li>
          </ul>
        <p>These investors are tired of using old financial services that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Charge them high fees</li>
          <li>Do not present them with the best investment options available</li>
          <li>Are committed to the profit of banks or brokers and not to generate the best results for investors</li>
          <li>Do not respect the investor's needs, according to their objectives</li>
          <li>Do not be precisely informed about the risks</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Pain</h1>
        <p>When getting rid of banks, some investors will soon find that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Managing an investment portfolio can involve dealing with dozens of assets at the same time.</li>
          <li>This work consumes a lot of time, which could be used in many more useful ways.</li>
          <li>The lack of a clear investment strategy can lead to act based on their momentaneal emotional states (<em>many times guided by euphoria or fear and anxiety</em>) and therefore poor financial decisions.</li>
          <li>Investment spreadsheets demand a lot of attention to be filled out, offer little automation and cannot handle the complexity of implementing certain investment strategies.</li>
        </ul>
